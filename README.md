## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the Brazilian E-commerce Dataset by Olist on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/olistbr/brazilian-ecommerce/data). The dataset has information of 100k orders from 2016 to 2018 made at multiple marketplaces in Brazil.

## Dataset Context

This dataset is provided by Olist, the largest department store in Brazilian marketplaces. Olist connects small businesses from all over Brazil to channels without hassle and with a single contract. Those merchants are able to sell their products through the Olist Store and ship them directly to the customers using Olist logistics partners.

After a customer purchases the product from Olist Store a seller gets notified to fulfill that order. Once the customer receives the product, or the estimated delivery date is due, the customer gets a satisfaction survey by email where he can give a note for the purchase experience and write down some comments.
